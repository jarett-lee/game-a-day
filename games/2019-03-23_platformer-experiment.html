<ul>
    <li>Install new version of Unity</li>
    <li>Experimented with physics-based platforming</li>
    <li>Unity physics engine is imprecise</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Can't set jump force based on block height</li>
            <li>Distance of jumper to ground is not always 0</li>
            <li>Have to handle sticking to walls by</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Setting wall friction to 0, which menas splitting the collider into multiple boxes, which means the platformer can get stuck</li>
                <li>Collision detection</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
