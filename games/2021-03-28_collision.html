        <h1>Collisions part 1 - Wall Collision</h1>

        <p>
            This collision code is incomplete and buggy. It only works in this specific example.
        </p>
        <p>
            The box moves dx * delta every update, then the update function checks for collisions. If there is a collision, the ball's x velocity reverses. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This does not handle y collisions, angled collisions, and most importantly there's a bug where if the ball moves into the wall with one delta and move out of the wall with less delta, the ball can get caught in the wall.
        </p>
