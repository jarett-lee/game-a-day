    <p>I had the feeling that I was being influenced by the number of views a video had. For example, when watching a comedy video, I saw that it didn't have a lot of views and I A) felt like the video should have more views and B) questioned whether the video was "really" that good. To prevent this influence, I decided to create a chrome extension that hid everything.</p>

      <li>getting a local chrome extension up and running is very easy</li>
      <li>document.querySelectorAll is very useful</li>
      <li>I would like a null check accessor like ?. in Kotlin</li>
